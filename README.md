# isometric_rendering
This is an engine that piggy backs off of love2D to render isometric textures. It uses matrix transforms and some scaling adjustments to do so with close to 0 performance impact.

# purpose
I built this to further understand the interactions between different geometric perspectives and to increase my skills in linear algebra. Enjoy!
